# sparta-project3

## Project Brief
The project is to refresh all of your skills that you have learnt since starting at Sparta. You will need to create a website in Sinatra (ERB) to call the NASA NeoWs - (Near Earth Object Web Service). We would expect it to be fully automated Unit, API and front end tested as part of the product.
